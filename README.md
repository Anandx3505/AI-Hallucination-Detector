# AI-Hallucination-Detector
The rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence and Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT, BERT, and LLaMA
has changed many sectors, including education, healthcare, finance, and customer service. These models
produce human-like text and offer quick, efficient answers to a range of user questions. However, a major
issue persists: AI hallucinations. Hallucinations occur when an AI system generates responses that sound
correct and fit the context but are factually wrong or completely made up. This problem not only confuses
users but also presents significant risks in fields where accuracy and reliability are crucial, such as medical
diagnosis, legal consultations, and financial predictions.
The main reason for hallucinations is the generative nature of LLMs, which predict the most likely next word
instead of checking facts from trusted sources. Current methods to reduce this issue, like prompt engineering,
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) have had
some success. However, they do not ensure factual accuracy. There is an urgent need for a strong AI
hallucination detection system that can recognize false or made-up information in real time.
The proposed project, AI Hallucination Detector, intends to address this issue by using machine learning and
natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The plan includes creating a labeled dataset of AI-generated
responses marked as factual or hallucinated. The project will use advanced algorithms, including Transformer-
based classifiers like BERT and RoBERTa, semantic similarity measures, and knowledge graph verification,
to find inconsistencies between AI outputs and confirmed knowledge. The system will also use evaluation
metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure its effectiveness. Additionally, the model
will be optimized for real-time detection and deployment through a web interface or API service.
By pursuing this strategy, the project aims to enhance the reliability of AI-generated content and reduce the
risks tied to misinformation. This solution will be essential for businesses, researchers, and individuals who
depend on AI for important decision-making, promoting responsible and ethical use of AI.
